# 👋 Hello there!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a student at a technology-focused high school in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.  
I'm passionate about programming and currently focused on front-end development.

Right now, I'm working with:

- 💻 HTML  
- 🎨 CSS  
- 🧠 C#

I enjoy designing and building beautiful, responsive user interfaces. I'm always exploring new ideas and improving my skills.

Feel free to check out my projects and follow my journey as a front-end developer!
